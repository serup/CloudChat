/**
 * The LZSS compression is a port of code as implemented for STEP.
 * The following information gives the history of this implementation.
 *
 * <p>Compression Info, 10-11-95<br/>
 * Jeff Wheeler</p>
 *
 * <h2><u>Source of Algorithm</u></h2>
 *
 * <p>The compression algorithms used here are based upon the algorithms developed and published by Haruhiko Okumura in a paper entitled "Data Compression Algorithms of LARC and LHarc."  This paper discusses three compression algorithms, LSZZ, LZARI, and LZHUF.  LZSS is described as the "first" of these, and is described as providing moderate compression with good speed.  LZARI is described as an improved LZSS, a combination of the LZSS algorithm with adaptive arithmetic compression.  It is described as being slower than LZSS but with better compression.  LZHUF (the basis of the common LHA compression program) was included in the paper, however, a free usage license was not included.</p>
 *
 * <p>The following are copies of the statements included at the beginning of each source code listing that was supplied in the working paper.</p>
 *
 *         <blockquote>LZSS, dated 4/6/89, marked as "Use, distribute and
 *         modify this program freely."</blockquote>
 *
 *         <blockquote>LZARI, dated 4/7/89, marked as "Use, distribute and
 *         modify this program freely."</blockquote>
 *
 *         <blockquote>LZHUF, dated 11/20/88, written by Haruyasu Yoshizaki,
 *         translated by Haruhiko Okumura on 4/7/89.  Not
 *         expressly marked as redistributable or modifiable.</blockquote>
 *
 * <p>Since both LZSS and LZARI are marked as "use, distribute and modify freely" we have felt at liberty basing our compression algorithm on either of these.</p>
 *
 * <h2><u>Selection of Algorithm</u></h2>
 *
 * <p>Working samples of three possible compression algorithms are supplied in Okumura's paper.  Which should be used?</p>
 *
 * <p>LZSS is the fastest at decompression, but does not generated as small a compressed file as the other methods. The other two methods provided, perhaps, a 15% improvement in compression.  Or, put another way, on a 100K file, LZSS might compress it to 50K while the others might approach 40-45K.  For STEP purposes, it was decided that decoding speed was of more importance than tighter compression. For these reasons, the first compression algorithm implemented is the LZSS algorithm.</p>
 *
 * <h2><u>About LZSS Encoding</u></h2>
 *
 * <p>(adapted from Haruhiko Okumura's paper)</p>
 *
 * <p>This scheme was proposed by Ziv and Lempel [1].  A slightly modified version is described by Storer and Szymanski [2]. An implementation using a binary tree has been proposed by Bell [3].</p>
 *
 * The algorithm is quite simple.<br/>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Keep a ring buffer which initially contains all space characters.</li>
 * <li>Read several letters from the file to the buffer.</li>
 * <li>Search the buffer for the longest string that matches the letters just read, and send its length and position into the buffer.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>If the ring buffer is 4096 bytes, the position can be stored in 12 bits.  If the length is represented in 4 bits, the <position, length> pair is two bytes long.  If the longest match is no more than two characters, then just one character is sent without encoding.  The process starts again with the next character.  An extra bit is sent each time to tell the decoder whether the next item is a character of a <position, length> pair.</p>
